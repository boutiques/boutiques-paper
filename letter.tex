\opening{Dear Editors,}

We would like to thank you for offering us the opportunity to revise
and re-submit our paper entitled ``Boutiques: a flexible framework to integrate
command-line applications in computing platforms'' to GigaScience.

The remainder of this letter contains our answer to the 2 reviews that
we received following the evaluation process. A revised version of the
manuscript follows.

We thank you again for your time and consideration, and we remain
available for any further information you may need.
